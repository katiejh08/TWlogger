JAF: I also need to figure out how to create depid when there are multiple individuals involved. For my test, I manually set depid. It's not a huge deal, but it's in the ggtitle and in the file name.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
datax <- load("./00Data/accTW.RData")
#datax <-accTW # for JAF


# Plot successive subsets of data and save to file
chunkLength <- 30 # Set length (in minutes) of chunks to plot
fs <- 1 
# i = 1 # Can set number of plots to print and run for loop from test to p

IDlist = unique(datax$ID)

for(j in 1:length(unique(datax$ID))) {
  datatemp <- datax %>% 
    dplyr::filter(ID==IDlist[j])
  depid <- datatemp$ID[1]
  for(i in 1:ceiling(nrow(datatemp)/(chunkLength *60*fs))) {
    test <- datatemp[seq(((i-1)*chunkLength*fs*60)+1,i*chunkLength*fs*60),]
    p <- test %>%
      gather(axis, acc, Ax:Az) %>%
      ggplot(aes(dttz, acc, color = axis)) +
      geom_line() +
      theme_classic() +
      labs(x = "Time", y = "Acceleration") +
      ggtitle(depid)
    p
    # save plots as .png
    ggsave(p, file=paste(depid,'-',i, ".png", sep=''), scale=2)
  }
}
```
